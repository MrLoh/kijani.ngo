# Kijani Blog Theme

This part of the repository contains the theme (CSS + jQuert Scripts) for styling the blog.

The fonts are partially provided through my Typekit, but should be accessible on localhost as well.

The styles are written in Sass. Grunt is included for running Autoprefixer (enables cross-browser compatibility), Sass compiling, and CSS/JS minifying. To use it:

1. Run `npm install` once to install dependencies.
2. Use `grunt` to prefix, sass compile and minify, or `grunt watch` to automatically compile on save.
